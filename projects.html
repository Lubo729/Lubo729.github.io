									<h2>Senior Capstone Project</h2>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="i/Team16_BEEM_Expo_Poster.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>For my senior capstone project, I served as the test engineer for a year-long collaboration with the BEEM Lab (Boulder Experimental Electronics and Manufacturing Laboratory). Our project involved creating an integrated sensor testing system for growing media. Our team aimed to create an integrated housing that uses screen-printed transducer sensors to measure NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) nutrient levels in hydroponic fluid. We collaborated with clients to establish project scope and requirements for a startup company, rapidly prototyped and iteratively refined the device to interface housing and electronic systems, and utilized various 3D printing manufacturing methods to optimize quality and performance. Additionally, I developed test procedures, evaluated data, and provided recommendations derived from results, ultimately helping improve efficiency for hydroponic farmers by streamlining the testing process.

									<h2>Drill Powered Bike</h2>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="i/dpb.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Another project was to create a bike that is powered by a hand drill in which you can only use either the front or back half of a standard bicycle. Our team engineered a unique bike using the rear half of a traditional bicycle. We crafted a custom steering mechanism and machined parts using CNC technology. This hands-on experience deepened our understanding of gears, bearings, pillow blocks, and shafts. Through challenges like obstacle courses and hill climbs, our creation proved not just functional but also resilient and efficient. This project showcased our ability to blend creativity with mechanical design.

									<h2>Cogeneration Plant System</h2>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="i/thermosystem.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>In my Thermodynamics class, we were tasked with improving upon the design of a cogeneration power plant system. Our goal was to add necessary equipment to create a functional design without violating any laws of thermodynamics. This meant ensuring that we did not exceed certain temperature, pressure, quality, or mass flow limits based on specific equipment capabilities. We used a variety of modeled equipment, including compressors, turbines, heat exchangers, pumps, condensers, process heaters, mixers, and more. Despite the complexity of the task, our team successfully created a model that met all the guidelines. This project was incredibly educational, teaching me about cycles and larger power systems, as well as the specific purposes of different equipment in relation to thermodynamics. It highlighted how each piece of a system plays a crucial role and how small changes can have a significant impact on the overall efficiency and functionality of a system.</p>

									<h2>Coding a Sudoku Game</h2>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="i/codeyay.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>One of my notable coding projects was the creation of a Sudoku game. The project challenged us to create a game with at least 4 classes, a minimum number of objects in each class, interactive components, and a sorting algorithm, among other specifications. In my game, players can choose a difficulty level from 1 to 5, with pre-chosen boards for each level. Players start with 100 points and lose points each time they request help. The game features interactive elements such as getting rules, adding and deleting numbers, and saving the game for later. The user-friendly format aims to provide an enjoyable experience for players of all skill levels. Working on this project provided me with valuable experience in coding and creating a larger project with many different files, classes, and objects interacting with each other. It was a challenging yet rewarding project that enhanced my coding skills and taught me how to create complex interactive systems.</p>

									<h2>Heat Transfer of Fins</h2>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="i/FinPoster.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>One of my notable school projects involved measuring a metal fin's ability to transfer heat, where we compared different diameters and materials. We experimented with steel, brass, and aluminum fins, testing six different diameters for each material. By applying heat to one end of the fin using a resistive heater and measuring the temperature at the base, we found that fins with larger diameters and materials with higher thermal conductivity were more effective at transferring heat away from the source. This project provided me with valuable experience in data collection and analysis, the project process, and creating a successful experimental project to compare with theoretical analysis.</p>

									<h2>Freshmen Year Projects</h2>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="i/goos lock poster.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>In my freshmen projects class, we embarked on several innovative projects. One of our endeavors was aimed at enhancing security and transportation around campus. For this project, we designed a bike lock featuring an electronic keypad and spring system, eliminating the need for a physical key. This endeavor provided me with hands-on experience in electronics, Arduino programming, 3D printing, and working on an iterative project. It was a valuable introduction to practical engineering and problem-solving.</p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="i/GoosCar.jpg" alt="" /></span>Another memorable project from my freshmen projects class was the challenge to build a makeshift vehicle using restricted materials. This vehicle was designed to complete tasks such as reaching specific speeds, stopping on a target, and dropping a small object. This project was among my first experiences with hands-on engineering projects of this nature, and it set the tone for the exciting projects I would undertake in the years to come.
